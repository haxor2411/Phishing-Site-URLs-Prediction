# Phishing URL Detection

A machine learning model to detect phishing URLs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model achieves 96.7% accuracy in identifying malicious URLs.

## Overview

This project implements a phishing URL detection system that can classify URLs as either legitimate ('good') or phishing ('bad'). It uses text processing and machine learning techniques to analyze URL characteristics and make predictions.

## Features

- URL text preprocessing using tokenization and stemming
- Machine learning models comparison (Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes)
- Interactive visualization of URL patterns and model performance
- Web scraping capabilities to analyze URL redirects
- Trained model export for deployment

## Requirements
